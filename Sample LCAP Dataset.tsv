Ventura	BriggsElementary	$442,977	12.41%	 Briggs Elementary School District has over 80% unduplicated pupils in the LCFF subgroups. In school year 2014/2015 the supplemental/concentration funding will be $442,977.00. The funds will be used to assist in purchasing common core intervention materials and diagnostics assessments, tutoring sessions, Summer Academy, transportation van, parent materials, time and services required to support parent and student engagement outside of the regular school day (night classes, meetings, childcare), and payment for counseling support services to address the social emotional needs of unduplicated students. D. C	 By increasing time for certificated and qualified personnel to provide intervention or acceleration of targeted subgroups and by improving access to technology, school resources, parent outreach, students in subgroups will increase their academic achievement. By focusing expenditures on improving school connectedness for parents and students, the district students will begin to close the achievement gap between other districts with lower populations of our targeted subgroups. Services for students within the subgroups should increase by about 12.41%. The expenditures specified for the subgroups meet or exceed the 12.41% threshold. N
Ventura	ConejoValleyUnified	$3,713,151	2.82%	 In 2014-15, Supplemental Grant funding is $3,713,151. All of the projected increase in 2014-15 Supplemental Grant funds will be distributed directly to school sites. None of the additional funds will be spent at the District office level. Supplemental Grant funds will be provided to school sites using the following formula: $10 per student for all students $40 per student for identified English learners, low income, redesignated English fluent and foster students (targeted students) In order to provide Supplemental Grant funds sufficient to support an academic intervention program at every school, regardless of the population of targeted students, $10 per student for all school site students will be provided directly to school sites. In addition, $40 per student for all school site identified targeted students will be provided to generate larger sums of Supplemental Grant funds at schools with larger populations of targeted students. School sites will use these funds to provide focused, academic intervention programs for all students identified as falling below grade level standards in ELA and Math, utilizing the District-adopted RtI model. Implementing comprehensive, school- wide academic intervention programs for struggling students utilizing a research-based RtI model has been demonstrated to be highly effective in improving student academic outcomes. D. C	 The minimum proportionality percentage (MPP) is 2.82%. One hundred percent of the projected increase in 2014-15 Supplemental Grant funds will be distributed directly to school sites utilizing the formula described in Section 3-C. The formula provides a base of Supplemental Grant funds for schools in proportion to overall school size, but the great majority of increased Supplemental Grant funds is provided based upon a school's population of targeted students. These funds will be used exclusively to provide focused academic intervention programs to students identified as falling below grade level academic standards, utilizing the District-adopted, researched-based RtI model. Based upon Spring 2013 District CST assessment results, approximately 51.9% of all English learner students and 47.8% of all low Income students required academic intervention, while approximately 15.9% of non-targeted students required intervention. The District does not have this data for the foster student subgroup. The overwhelming majority of increased Supplemental Grant funds will be expended on increased academic intervention services for targeted students. In future years, as Supplemental Grant funds continue to increase, funds will continued to be directed to school sites, and in addition academic intervention, will be used to provide social/emotional intervention services to targeted students, and to provide targeted students with expanded opportunities for academic enrichment and accelerated learning. N
Ventura	FillmoreUnified	$2,100,000	11%	 For the 2014-15 school year, Fillmore Unified School District (FUSD) will receive an additional estimated $2,100,000 in supplemental and concentration funding. The funding will be directed on a district wide basis toward increasing certificated and classified staffing for newly targeted or improved programs and services Â_ Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) serving all grade levels to assist in CCSS curriculum development plus instructional and teacher support; authorized teachers for specific EL instruction including staffing for upcoming dual language, newcomer and long-term EL instructional programs ; reading specialists at the elementary grade levels; increased counseling services and staffing for at-risk and foster youth; improved and increased technology in the classroom and sites to meet uniform NETS and CTAP standards; ongoing PD for CCSS, the new ELD standards, implementation of NGSS, multiple new or ongoing program participation with WRITE, GLAD, Brainware Safari, Writing Task Force, and other instructional strategies Â_ scaffolding, differentiated instruction, checking for understanding, etc. Â_ focused on increasing measurable academic achievement for all students. D. C	 For the 2014-15 schoolyear, an 11% increase in services for unduplicated students will occur in comparison to those provided to all pupils in the LCAP year. These increased or improved services will address goals, actions and services that wereprioritized by the FUSD stakeholder groups and recorded in the current plan (including additionally identified items that may be considered for future reference and later selection). In order to achieve an 11% increase in district wide services for LI, EL and FY students, FUSD will be hiring staff, purchasing new programs, and providing PDthat focus on improving student achievement for these significant subgroups. Actions include hiring authorized teachers to implement a new dual language instruction program at the elementary level, EL authorized teachers to provide appropriate classroom instruction and developing RTI2 at the secondary level, IAs to help with newcomer and long-term ELs; purchasing new programs Â_ In the USA, English 3D, Ramps to Reading, WRITE, GLAD, Brainware Safari - and providing related ongoing PD. Formal services will be provided to increase EL, LI and FY student representation in AP, honors and college prep level courses; and before, during and after school academic, computer literacy and EL support will be designed to serve student subgroups in addition to providing parent education - language instruction and computer literacy for targeted subgroups. Additional counseling services are also planned including dedicated responsibilities for FY students Â_ monitoring progress, providing advisement and acting as a school-home-agency liaison. N
Ventura	HuenemeElementary	$7,200,000	13.66%	 The majority of students attending schools in the Hueneme Elementary School District fit into the subgroups of English Language Learners (64%) and socio-economically disadvantaged (83%) students. Although the district serves foster youth, they represent a very small percentage of our total student population. Based on our student composition, the District has chosen to use and allocate the LCAP funding on a districtwide basis. The District will receive approximately $7,200,000 in supplemental and concentration grant funding in 2014-2015. A review of District needs and metrics, along with input from key stakeholders, helped the District LCAP Committee determine that spending dollars for the following services would be the most effective use of supplemental grant funds. These include counseling support, parent education programs, supplemental intervention programs and resources, extended learning opportunities, and enhanced campus security. Our review of research and best practices for student achievement indicates students require this additional support, and that educating parents also benefits students because they become engaged in their children's education and can help motivate them to succeed. D. C	 In meeting the Minimum Proportionality Percentage (MPP), the Hueneme Elementary School District will be increasing and/or improving services for unduplicated students by 13.66%. The district will accomplish this goal by (1) lowering class size in grades TK-3; (2) increasing the number of English learner support teachers, technology teachers, music/band teachers, school counselors, paraprofessionals and assistant principals; and (3) providing new instructional materials and technology for the implementation of the common core state standards. Additional counseling services will be added to all elementary and junior high schools with a focus on supporting the social-emotional needs of students, and parent and student engagement. The counselors will serve as the school liaison for foster youth. The unique needs of these students will be improved through the development and implementation of comprehensive support services. HESD operates many large elementary schools. In order to increase safety, supervision and support services, an assistant principal will be added to schools having more than 700 students. This will also allow the school principal to spend time in classrooms supporting teachers with the implementation of the common core state standards. As the common core state standards are implemented, the number of individual technology devices available to students will be increased. A new district technology teacher will provide training for teachers, paraprofessionals and parents. HESD will improve services to our English Learners by providing professional development on the English Language Development (ELD) Standards. Three new District English learner support teachers will work with classroom teachers in designing, implementing and monitoring the ELD program. Adding three new teachers doubles the number of District English learner support teachers. Extended learning opportunities will be provided for English learners. These opportunities include a summer boot camp and after school homework help. Bilingual instructional assistants will provide intervention for English learners during the school day. HESD will provide additional support staff, such as health clerks, at schools to increase the engagement of low income parents in our schools and district. The new health clerks will be a point of contact for support for parents. The addition of health clerks will also allow nursing services to be increased for low income students. N
Ventura	MesaUnionElementary	$145,503	3.69%	 Supplemental grant funds in 2014-2015 will total $145,503. Mesa Union is expending these additional funds in 2014-2015 to increase academic performance among all students, with particular emphasis on low income, foster youth and English learners. The district also is using funds to increase student safety and parent participation. Supplemental funding is targeted to serve low income, foster youth and English learners through professional development and extended day and year activities. Supplemental funds also will be used to support parent involvement initiatives that promote learning at home. D. C	 The Mesa Union School District Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) streamlines services to support learning for all students, with particular attention to English learners, low-income students and foster youth. The plan's underlying theory of action is that the staff continuously will improve its capacity to serve students through strategic professional learning, additional time and individualized instruction based on student achievement data (Miles and Frank, 2008). Staff also will coordinate activities that draw more families, especially families of these target groups, into the daily life of the school. Expenditures align to these ends. Services for students within the subgroups will be increased or improved by about 3.69%, compared to all students. Expenditures specified for targeted subgroups meet or exceed the 3.69% threshold. N
Ventura	MoorparkUnified	$1,500,000	3.56%	 Moorpark Unified School District will receive $1.5 million in Supplemental Local Control Funding Formula Funds beginning in 2014-15. This amount will increase to approximately $1.7 million in 2015-16 and $1.4 million in 2016-17. (These funds include $625,000 in previously awarded EIA funds.) These funds are calculated based on the number of English learners, students identified as low income, and foster youth. MUSD will offer a variety of programs and supports specifically for English learners, low income students and foster youth. These include: 2 ELD TOSAs ($175,000), supporting implementation through coaching and modeling of ELD lessons, increased site counseling services (3 FTE - $300,000), and AVID and IDEAS. District services and programs that are aligned with LCAP goals that serve all students ($90,000 to sites): intervention counseling at Moorpark HS and all middle schools (1 FTE - $104,000), RTI teachers, extended day ELD services ($48,000), reduced class sizes at elementary schools and secondary (2 FTE - $144,000), CHAMPS positive behavior support and restorative practices ($15,000), . District-wide implementation of these practices will not only have an impact on learning environment and the climate of the school as a whole but will also have a greater positive impact on our targeted subgroups with a focus on our LTEL students. The district recognizes that while these funds are generated in order to serve the focus students, some services may, should the need arise, be utilized for students outside the focus subgroups. While the many of students served will be focus students, there are other students in need that the district cannot ignore such as our Special Education students. By providing the services identified without limitations, MUSD will best serve all students. The full list of expenditures is aligned with the goals of the MUSD Local Control and Accountability Plan and addresses the needs of our district's English learners, low Income students and foster youth. School staff and School Site Councils will align their Single School Plans for Achievement to the goals and actions of the adopted Local Control Accountability Plan. D. C	 Moorpark Unified School District - Proportionality Calculation 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Estimated Total LCFF Funding 42,766,332 45,696,707 49,052,558 50,915,002 Estimated Base Grant 42,972,994 46,122,977 48,366,422 Estimated Supplemental Grant Funding 1,529,893 1,735,761 1,354,760 Minimum Proportionality Percentage 3.56% 3.76% 2.80% MUSD will provide an additional 3.56% services for all unduplicated student groups. The District will focus on the needs of our LTELs through improvement of our EL/RFEP services. Professional development on the English Language Development (ELD) Standards and implementation of them will include site administrators, teachers, and paraeducators who work with English Learners. Through this targeted professional development MUSD staff will develop an understanding of the ELD standards leading to changes in improved ELD classroom instruction and/or courses for students. The unique needs of these students will be improved through the development and implementation of comprehensive support services. Engagement of parents of our identified stakeholder students to support their students is another key aspect of the 201415 LCAP. MUSD will focus on increasing parental participation in programs for English Learners and low SES. This may include offering additional parent education and involvement programs at all schools. MUSD will also provide additional Spanish bilingual support staff at some schools to increase the engagement of Spanish speaking parents in our schools and district. MUSD has not previously tracked Foster Youth students. Beginning with the 20142015 school year, we will improve our partnership with stakeholders who work directly with Foster Youth, and will provide improved services by developing and implementing a system for identifying and tracking our Foster Youth enrolled in the school district.

Ventura	MupuElementary	$53,086	4.97%	 Mupu Elementary has over 55% unduplicated pupils in the LCFF subgroups. In School Year 2014/15, Supplemental/Concentration funding will be about $53,086, or about 4.97% of total LCFF Funding. The funds expended from the Supplemental and Concentration funding sources align with all the goals of the LCAP. Funds are to assist in the purchase of intervention materials and services, to pay for services and materials required to promote parent and student engagement, and to pay for services to provide counseling for students who require support. D. C	 By increasing time for certificated and qualified personnel to provide intervention or acceleration of targeted subgroups and by improving access to technology and digital resources, students in those subgroups will increase their academic achievement. By focusing expenditures on improving school connectedness for parents and students, students and parents will improve their understanding of what proficient achievement looks like and realize that proficiency is within their reach. Services for students within the subgroups will be increased or improved by 4.97%, compared to all students. The expenditures specified for the subgroups meet or exceed the 4.97% threshold. N
Ventura	OakParkUnified	$312,956	1%	 Oak Park USD has less than 9% unduplicated students who are low income, foster youth, and English learner pupils. We will receive $312,956 for the supplemental and concentration grant funding. The cost of these additional services exceeds this amount and will be supported in part by the supplemental dollars for our unduplicated count and in larger measure by the General Fund. Each child is a valued member of the student community and his or her success is a top priority. Because there is not a concentration of these students at any one school, the District provides Literacy aides, EL aides, Math aides at all sites to give additional instructional support to these students as needed. Support fluctuates on a site-by-site basis determined by the level of actual needs as identified by test scores, teacher input and other data. D. C	 The minimum proportionality percentage for Oak Park Unified School District is 1%. Increased English Language aides and additional training to serve eligible students, foster youth liaison, will secure services for the appropriate sub groups. We have found that this is the most effective use of funds, and is evidenced by the District's long history of high test scores and college-ready achievement among all its students, regardless of economic, foster, or English learner status. N
Ventura	OceanView	$1,300,000	16%	 Calculated on the basis of the number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner pupils as determined pursuant to 5 CCR 15496(a)(5), OVSD minimum proportionality percentage is 16%. The amount of LCFF funds expected to be generated by unduplicated students is estimated to be $1.3 million. Our percent of unduplicated pupils is 84%, and all sites exceed 55%, so we are expending funds districtwide. The districtwide services are the most effective use of the supplemental and concentration grant increase for unduplicated students in meeting the states priorities. Since these students are 84% of the school enrollment. they will benefit most from actions and services that improve the entire school and district program and related services which are designed to meet the 8 state priorities, and the district goals. How districtwide services are directed to meeting the district goals for the unduplicated students in the state priority areas st English learner and low income students will benefit from acquiring 21 century skills, having a safe learning environment where they feel engaged and connected, where they have high quality materials, well maintained facilities, well trained educators, and involved parents.

Ventura	OjaiUnified	$592,493	3.44%	 The district received $592,493 of increased LCFF supplemental grant funds based upon the number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner pupils. As a result of stakeholder input, the District is providing smaller classes, targeted instruction, after-school academic support, additional counseling, instructional materials and services, and teacher professional development. In addition, the use of the supplemental funds on a district-wide basis is the most June 24, 2014 of 27 effective use of the funds to meet the state's eight priority areas and the mutual goals of the district and stakeholders for the unduplicated count of low income, foster youth, and English Learner. D. C	 Ojai Unified School District's percentage by which services for low income, foster youth, and English learner that must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students is 3.44%. In order to meet this proportionality percentage, the District is providing smaller classes, targeted instruction, after-school academic support, additional counseling, instructional materials and services, and teacher professional development. The District is ensuring increased and improved services for the unduplicated count of low income, foster youth, and English learners as compared to the services provided to all pupils. N
Ventura	Oxnard	$12,213,105	10.94%	 Oxnard School District is receiving a projected $12,213,105 in supplemental and concentration grant funding. The district has 89.77% of our enrollment qualified as an unduplicated pupil for purposes of this funding and each site exceeds 40% enrollment of unduplicated students. The OSD administrative team worked collaboratively with parents from DELAC and Foster Youth as well as OEA, CSEA, and OSSA union leaders to write the LCAP to meet the needs of all the children in the district with emphasis for children that are English Learners, low income, Foster Youth, and special education. On a districtwide basis, the plan supports the following: increased school safety and improving school climate Providing students access to STEAM through the implementation of CCSS Increasing parental involvement districtwide Focus on supporting the whole child by increasing support staff (school counselors, outreach specialists, nurses) and resources at sites Increasing student achievement for all children, especially special education students, Foster Youth, low income students, and English Learners, ensuring access to core Supporting basic level of support for facilities, appropriate materials for children, and highly qualified teachers. In order to meet the above needs in our district, the total LCFF supplemental grant funding will be directed toward the sites as well at the district level. In addition, the supplemental grant funding is strategically targeted to support English Learners, Foster Youth, and low income children. These funds will also be used to provide targeted academic intervention for all students that are identified as needing support as well as in the social and emotional areas. D. C	 Oxnard School Districts projected Minimum Proportionality Percentage (MPP) is 10.94% for the budget year. The services described below represent an increase in service to our unduplicated students of 10.94%. In order to support academic success for English Learners, Foster Youth, and low income children, the majority of the LCFF supplemental grant funds will be distributed to sites and a portion will be provided at the district level. The targeted supplemental funds will be provided to these children through academic intervention as needed following a RTI2 model. In addition, it is important that our children's families are also part of the plan, and there are funds to support an increase in parental involvement. Research has shown that having parents actively involved with their child's education does support an increase in a child's social as well as academic achievement. In addition, the supplemental funds will be used to build capacity for parent involvement at the school sites as well as at the district level. The district will support school sites by ensuring that the supplemental funds are also targeted at increasing school attendance and supporting children and families where there is a need. The Outreach Specialists that will be assigned to each of the school sites will support this targeted group of children to ensure that the district is strengthening and supporting student learning and development by having their child at school and on time daily. The LCFF supplemental grant funds greatly support the areas of need for English Learners in the district. The districts EL Master Plan will be re- evaluated and all staff will be provided professional development around the EL Master Plan to ensure that it is being implemented to support the children's needs. In addition, the district is responding to the needs of the community and the stakeholder input by opening five more Dual rd Language Immersion Programs. In addition, a 3 grade newcomer's academy will be opening in fall of 2014 to support the needs of our English Learners. The stakeholders during the LCAP writing committee expressed a need to have a Community Liaison to support the needs of Foster Youth, English Learners and low income children. This will be a new position in the district pending approval of the LCAP. This position will provide great resource support to our families and children in the district. There will be a clearer line of communication from when the families enroll their child at the Enrollment Center to the classroom teacher to ensure that the child will have his or her needs met in a timely manner. The Community Liaison will also increase the district's focus on supporting and increasing parental involvement in schools. N
Ventura	PleasantValley	$717,000	3%	 Goal #1, #2, #3 -We anticipate receiving approximately $717K of supplemental funds so the district will be using the funding to support Low Income, Foster Youth, and English Learners. Best Use: Because our targeted students (Low Income, Foster Youth, and English Learners= 31%) are distributed throughout the district in all schools, we will support these targeted students on a district-wide basis. D. C	 Supplemental funds spent on Low Income, Foster Youth, and English Learners to increase the services by 3%. The services are: Access to technology used for intervention and targeted instruction for Low Income, Foster Youth, and English Learners and support by Teachers on Special Assignment and hourly teachers for instruction, professional development and parent training.

Ventura	RioElementary	$4,300,000	14%	 Rio School District's increase in funds in the LCAP year calculated on the basis of the number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner pupils 84.34% for unduplicated student population as determined pursuant to 5 CCR 15496(a)(5) is estimated to be $4.3 million. Rio School District is expending these funds to provide zero period for academic supports and increase English learner access to electives, support class size reduction with highest percentage of unduplicated students in kindergarten, provide six weeks of summer programming for migrant, low-income and English learner students and systemize protocols and processes for the use of language proficiency assessments for the purpose of placement into and exit from English Language Development programs and to inform daily instruction. Rio School District is using supplemental and concentration funds in a districtwide manner. These services are the most effective use of funds to meet the district's goals for unduplicated pupils in the state priority areas. B. C	 The services provided in the LCAP year provide for increased or improved services for low income pupils, foster youth and English learners in proportion to the increase in funding provided for such pupils in that year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR 15496(a)(7). Services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all pupils in the LCAP year by 14% as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR 15496(a). The qualitative description of increased and/or improved services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all pupils includes, providing zero period for academic supports and increased electives for English learners, kindergarten class size reduction for the highest percentage of unduplicated students, summer programming for migrant, low-income and English learner students and systemizing protocols and processes around language proficiency. N
Ventura	SantaClaraElementary	$17,027	4.20%	 Santa Clara has 10% unduplicated pupils in the LCFF subgroups. In the school year 2014/15, the Supplemental/concentration funding will be about $17,027. The funds expended from the Supplemental/Concentration funding sources align with the goals of the LCAP. Funds are to assist in the purchase of intervention/acceleration materials and services and to pay for services to promote student and parent engagement. The school will provide access to parents after school hours to use technology. Instructional aides will be used to provide services to unduplicated students. D. C	 Students in the subgroups will increase academic achievement by increasing their time and access to intervention/acceleration materials and services and their parents access to technology. By improving student and parent engagement in school community, students and parents will increase their understanding of what proficient student achievement is and how to obtain proficiency. Services for students within the subgroups will be increased or improved by about 4.20%, compared to all students. The expenditures for the subgroups meet or exceed the 4.20% threshold. N
Ventura	SantaPaulaUnified	$4,800,000	13.07%	 For the 2014-2015 School Year, the Santa Paula Unified School District will receive $4,800,000 in Local Control Funding Formula Funds based on the unduplicated number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner pupils. As indicated on the introduction to the LCAP, the majority of students attending the Santa Paula Unified School District fit in to the subgroups of English Language Learners (42%) and socio-economically disadvantaged (83.4%) students. Although the district serves foster youth, they represent a very small percentage of our total student population. Based on our student composition, the District has chosen to use and allocate the LCAP funding in a District-Wide basis. In meeting both the State and the District goals, we will use a significant amount of funds for professional development. We recognize that universal high expectations for all students require an ongoing effort towards improvement in curriculum, instruction, assessment, and leadership support systems. These improvements require a continued cycle of effective professional development to expand our teachers' knowledge, skills, and instructional practices. The District has chosen a Professional Learning Community Model for teachers and leadership training. The District will also use LCAP funds to extend library hours, provide a multi-tiered system of educational and/or behavioral interventions for all struggling learners and will effectively use data analysis to guide instruction. In an effort to assure that our high school students are prepared for college and career, we will use the new funding to assure better course access for all students, develop a dual enrollment program with Ventura College, increase advanced placement course offerings, increase career and technical educational courses and programs and expand our career pathways at both middle school and high school. Specialized academic strands will be implemented at K-5 to guide children in developing their interests and aptitudes. As the District approaches full implementation of Common Core we will utilize increased funding through LCAP to emphasize a District-wide focus and effort towards supporting high levels of student achievement at every site. Support to Common Core implementation will include additional coaching and intervention personnel in the areas of English Language Arts, Mathematics and English Language Development; purchase additional instructional materials to support our State adoptions; upgrade our technology infrastructure to be able to meet the instructional and assessment requirements of Common Core implementation. As a District in which 94% of our families are of Hispanic origin, we are committed to provide a culturally sensitive and competent learning environment for all our students. Parent engagement and school climate become key components in creating and maintaining a culturally competent educational system. To that extent, the District will implement the PIQE Program at all schools. Through the PIQE Program, the District will reach out to parents as partners in their child's education and will share with parents information and strategies to keep track and support their child's success. To expand our family support services and improve school climate we are committing LCAP funds to hire highly qualified school counselors and bilingual family liaison specialists. It is the District's expectation that these mental health and community outreach professionals will work at each site connecting families to needed services and/or to resources needed by students to ensure their success at school. Finally, the District will commit funding to improving our facilities, adding maintenance and clerical staff to all school sites. It is our goal to have our District offer safe, clean and modern 21st Century facilities and classrooms which will support the academic, emotional, social and physical needs of the whole child. D. C	 In meeting the Minimum Proportionality Percentage (MPP), the Santa Paula Unified will need to spend a minimum of 13.07% of the LCAP new funding in Year 1 to serve our English Language Learners, Foster Youth and Economically Disadvantaged students. The District will accomplish this goal by increasing Reading Intervention Teachers, English Language Development Coaches, School Counselors and Family Liaison Specialists. The increase of these direct services at every school site will exceed the funds that need to be spent in supporting these students. N
Ventura	SimiValleyUnified	$3,668,448	3%	 Simi Valley Unified School District has 5947 unduplicated pupils in the LCFF subgroups. In the school year 2014-2015, supplemental/concentration funding will be about $3,668,448. The funds expended from the supplemental funding sources align with all the goals of the LCAP. Funds will be used for the implementation of a comprehensive intervention program, increased monitoring and counseling of students, implementation of targeted programs for long-term ELs, on-going teacher professional development on ELD Standards and effective instructional strategies, the purchase of ELD materials and resources, the promotion of parent involvement through workshops and information meetings, and increased parental digital access. D. C	 The percent by which the services will be improved or increased for the specified subgroups will be 3% compared to all students. By providing intervention for targeted subgroups, student performance will improve and the achievement gap will be reduced. Materials for ELD will align instruction to the ELD Standards and link instruction to the Common Core. Student and parent workshops will increase awareness of and access to services including A-G coursework and other school-based resources for which subgroup participation is under-representative of the total population. By embedding focus on best practices for our subgroups in all ongoing professional development, teachers and administrators will be better prepared to respond to the needs of said subgroups. N
Ventura	SomisUnion	$122,000	7.65%	 Somis Elementary has over 68% unduplicated pupils in the LCFF subgroups. In School Year 2014/15, Supplemental/Concentration funding will be about $122,000. The funds expended from the Supplemental and Concentration funding sources align with all the goals of the LCAP. Funds are to assist in the purchase of intervention materials, technology, and services, to pay for services and materials required to promote parent and student engagement, and to pay for services to provide counseling for students who require support. D. C	 By increasing time for certificated and qualified personnel to provide intervention or acceleration of targeted subgroups and by improving access to technology and digital resources, students in those subgroups will increase their academic achievement. By focusing expenditures on improving school connectedness for parents and students, students and parents will improve their understanding of what proficient achievement looks like and realize that proficiency is within their reach. Services for students within the subgroups will be increased or improved by about 7.65%, compared to all students. The expenditures specified for the subgroups meet or exceed the7.65% threshold. N
Ventura	VenturaUnified	$5,200,000	4.75%	 Ventura Unified School District did not meet the 55% level of unduplicated students to receive concentration grant funds. VUSD will receive approximately $5.2 million in supplemental Local Control Funding Formula funds in 2014-15. The funds will be used to maintain and increase services and programs for our targeted students and in some cases all students within the District. The following are services to be provided to the unduplicated subgroups: after school computer and library access, supplemental common core materials, tutoring before school, after school and during Saturday school, intervention, increased counselor services targeting unduplicated student subgroups, and computer training for parents of unduplicated student subgroups, Occasionally, on a space available basis, some of the increased services will be implemented district-wide or school-wide at sites with less than 40% unduplicated student counts. At times a district-wide or school-wide implementation would be a more programmatically and/or operationally efficient method to deliver services to unduplicated students. The majority of students served will be targeted students. D. C	 Our minimum proportionality percentage is 4.75%. Ventura Unified will meet the MPP by providing the following increased services to our unduplicated students: Increased Services for Unduplicated Students After school computer lab and library access Staff training specifically focused on addressing the needs of unduplicated students Provide online vocabulary development resources Provide supplemental Common Core State Standards library and classroom materials for English Learner instruction Implement tutoring before school, after school, and during Saturday school Extend Library hours at all middle and high schools Increased student monitoring and timely intervention for unduplicated students Offer additional periods at secondary schools to increase academic opportunities. The periods will be used to th decrease class sizes, to offer 9 grade intervention courses, and to add zero period classes to allow students in intervention courses to participate in electives and athletics. Increased teacher collaboration time for schools with high numbers of Unduplicated students Increase counselors to provide additional access to unduplicated students th Develop and offer 9 grade English Language Arts courses. Increase AVID sections th th Explore options for 6 grade and 9 grade academies for unduplicated students Provide online bilingual Credit Recovery Programs for unduplicated students Increase after school activities for unduplicated students Develop multi lingual pathway recognition and awards Offer PIQE for the families of unduplicated students Offer computer instruction focused on district systems for parents of unduplicated students Implement the Latino Family Literacy Project at the K-5 level Provide support groups for caregivers Expand the Family Community Partnership Program N
Yolo	DavisJointUnified	$2,303,304	4.61%	 The Davis Joint Unified School District estimated Supplemental Grant funding was $2,303,304, calculated on the basis of the district's number and concentration of low income, foster youth and English learner pupils. Davis Joint Unified School District has a 27% enrollment of unduplicated pupils who are low income, foster youth and English learner pupils. The DJUSD supplemental funds will be used in a districtwide manner to fund three educational initiatives. 1. Supplemental funding will be used to lower class size in every kindergarten through third grade class. Our community believes this is the best way to address the needs of all students, and particularly important in meeting the needs of low income, foster youth and English learner, and redesignated fluent English proficient (RFEP) pupils who are enrolled in K-3 grade classes throughout the district. 2. Supplemental funding will be used to provide increased reading support by paraeducators in all third grade classes. Attention will be focused on strengthening the reading skills of struggling readers, students who most frequently are low income pupils, foster youth and/or English learners. 3. Through direction affirmed in the DJUSD strategic planning process, the Davis school district will be implementing local policy to provide technological devices to all students to use as educational tools. To ensure that those devises can be effectively used by low income, foster youth, English learner, and redesignated fluent English proficient (RFEP) pupils who may not have access to the internet, the district's technology infrastructure is being updated. Wireless access will be available for all students, but most importantly for students whose families do not have the resources to independently provide wireless access. D. C	 In 2014-15 the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all pupils is 4.61%. This district is qualitatively meeting the proportionality percentage by providing the following additional services to low income, foster youth and/or English learner pupils above those services provided to all pupils. The supplemental services include: 1. A reading intervention program at each junior high school 2. English Language Arts support classes at the comprehensive high school 3. An AVID program at the comprehensive high school and the three junior high feeder schools 4. An after-school family resource center and tutoring program for homeless students and their families at a district elementary school 5. Elementary school English learner support staff, including EL Specialist, EL paraeducators and other staff as determined by sites 6. Supplemental ELD materials 7. Long term English Learner (LTEL) instructors and instructional materials at the comprehensive high school and the three junior high feeder schools 8. Provision of summer reading materials for elementary LTEL students 9. Extended day tutoring and mentoring support at the comprehensive high school, and at the junior high school and elementary school with the highest grade span concentration of low income English learners 10. Leadership training for English learner parents 11. Professional growth in the areas of restorative practices and culturally responsive environments 12. Costs associated with increasing the inclusion in decision making of parents whose children are low income, foster youth and/or English learner pupils N
Yolo	EspartoUnified	$978,245	16.35%	 The Esparto Unified School District estimates that Supplemental/Concentration funding for 2014-2015 will be $978,245 which represents an increase of $840,991over prior years funding for these students. The district has developed goals and strategies to utilize these increased dollars. These dollars are being spent on increased during the school day interventions, extended day interventions, staff development, academic monitoring, readiness for the Common Core State Standards, implementation of Common Core lessons across the curriculum, and increased inquiry-based learning experiences. Students identified as English Learners and/or socio-economically disadvantaged students constitute the vast majority of all students in the district. The Esparto Unified School District serves a high percentage of unduplicated pupils, approximately 70%. Therefore, the activities, services, and expenditures included in this LCAP support district-wide and school-wide implementation of funds. D. C	 The percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to all pupils in the LCAP year is calculated as 16.35%. The Esparto Unified School District LCAP exceeds the proportionality requirement of the District, which is 4.45% This is accomplished by the expenditures designated for targeted reading intervention, extended-day tutoring, professional development for ELD, instructional materials services, financial support for parent involvement, and translation services.

Yolo	WashingtonUnified	$4,400,812	9.06%	 The Washington Unified School District uses the LCCF Calculator Tool 2014 2015 Budget Version issued by the Fiscal Crisis Management and Assistance Team (FCMAT) to assist school districts in determining funding attributable to the supplemental and concentration grant calculation. Estimated additional Supplemental and Concentration grant funding is $2,885,582 for total estimated Supplemental and Concentration grant funding of $4,400,812. The details of the expenditures are identified in section 3.b and include English Learner Intervention Specialists, a Coordinator of English Language Learner Services, an increase in staff hours for current Home School Liaisons, the addition of a Home School Liaison, a Coordinator of Community Outreach Services, and increase in staff hours for current Outreach Specialists, the addition of an Outreach Specialist, the addition of an Outreach Specialist Â_ Foster Youth, staff release time for Foster Youth support, and the addition of a Career Specialist for Yolo Continuation High. Other actions and services include increased ELD training, intervention programs, bilingual program support, cultural competency training, ELD and intervention summer school, and support materials and supplies. In addition, funds are allocated to schools based on their unduplicated student counts to support their site level actions and services based on identified needs. While some funds are targeted to specific populations, some services are established as schoolwide or districtwide to support all learners who will benefit, but with a particular emphasis on the needs of the targeted groups. The district percentage of unduplicated pupils is 69.4% and the percentage at individual schools ranges from 47.3% to 100%. C. C	 The Washington Unified School District's estimated Minimum Proportional Percentage is calculated at 9.06 %. The percentage was calculated using the LCFF Calculator Tool 2014 2015 Budget Version issued by FCMAT. The Washington Unified School District has demonstrated that it has met the proportionality percentage by documenting an increase and/or improvement in services focused specifically on English learners, Foster Youth, and economically disadvantaged students which are over and above the services provided for all students. In addition to training, intervention programs, and support, staffing to provide services to this population is projected to be increased by 70% over the prior year services for these targeted groups.

Yolo	WintersJointUnified	$1,096,445	11.07%	 For the 2014-2015 LCAP year, Winters Joint Unified School District is receiving approximately $1,096,445 in Supplemental and Concentration funds. This represents an approximate increase of $1.2 M increase in comparison to the 2013-2014 funding level. The increased funds have been allocated to school sites as well as in support of districtwide goals. Winters Joint Unified School District has an unduplicated count of 70% currently. All additional dollars beyond the base amount will be targeted for low income, foster youth, and English learners. While our English Learners are often in pull out, or separate programs or classrooms, our low income students are not. For this reason what we do for "all students" impacts our low income students. Therefore, our LCAP resources are spread schoolwide and districtwide as our demographic is similar across schools and throughout the District. The exception to this is that Developmental Bilingual Education is offered at Winters Elementary. DBE is offered K-6. At the middle school and high school levels we have separate English Language Development classes offered for those students still acquiring fluency in the English language. The offering of a Developmental Bilingual Education program requires a commitment to additional staffing as well as budgets for additional instructional materials and supplies over and above the Williams requirement, due to having instructional materials in both English and Spanish for all subject areas. We also created a Director of Instruction with a focus on EL to support not only the successful implementation of DBE but also English Language Development classes across the District. To ensure a high quality teaching staff, we have set aside resources for training, the continuation of an induction program for new teachers, and unallocated dollars for increased compensation to teachers. Additionally, we have set aside dollars for anticipated increases to STRS and PERS contributions. D. C	 Our minimal proportionality percentage (MPP) for each of the three LCAP years is 11.07%, 14.53% and 15.22%. In our annual budgets for the three years we have surpassed this proportionality with increased or improved services for low income, Foster Youth and ELs. These subgroups get the benefits of these proportional dollars and also the benefits of funds and resources allocated to "all students" due to our size and our homogeneous population across our District. A significant percentage of our budget is allocated to supporting our EL populations in addition to our Special Education population. Additionally, we have added before and after school program budgets, Summer School budget, and some support staff budgets to address the needs of our unduplicated populations. Support staff include counselors, nurses, and library staff. The district will further improve services to our English Learners through a focused implementation of a soon-to-be adopted EL Master Plan, the creation of an oversight position or Director of Educational Programs with an EL emphasis, as well as added budgets for materials and supplies specific to ELD and the continued implementation of a new and very popular Developmental Bilingual Education program. Engagement of our parents of unduplicated students through programs like School2Home with its 80% parent participation rate will be critical. While our Foster Youth students do not meet the threshold of a significant subgroup, we will always endeavor to provide them the support that they need to be successful. Counselors, nurses, administration and teachers play a key role in this regard. We also partner with RISE and other agencies to support our Foster Youth. N
